Features
Semantic Structure: Use of meaningful tags to enhance readability and accessibility.
Improved Accessibility: Ensures compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
SEO Optimization: Clear content hierarchy for better indexing by search engines.
HTML Validation: Adheres to W3C standards for error-free and maintainable code.
